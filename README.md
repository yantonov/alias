This app helps you to define custom alias to command line utility which has no [alias support](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-alias).

Motivation: 
Let's suppose that git or mercurial, for example, has no alias support.  
Using this app you can define aliases and use it with corresponding program.

Usage:
1. Put the executable to path
2. Write config and put it near the executable
3. Use custom aliases

Sample config can be found [here](https://github.com/yantonov/aliases_experimental/raw/master/sample_config.toml).
